# ðŸ”¥ The Fire Pit ( Burn )

<mark style="color:green;">**2.5%**</mark> of all $ZENY traded are burnt in **The Fire Pit**. The more that is traded, the more get put into the fire causing the fire pit to grow in size, larger and larger through self-fulfilling Auto-Compounding, reducing the circulating supply and keeping the Safuu protocol stable.

The other benefit to an everlasting burn of circulating supply is that due to the deflationary nature of it, equates to a higher value of each $ZENY token, therefore increasing the individual value.
