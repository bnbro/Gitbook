# âž¡ Longterm Rebase Interest Cycle

In order to maintain sustainability and future growth, we have introduced a Long-term Rebase Interest Cycle component which will award $ZENY token holders with continued compound interest in perpetuity.

Each Interest Cycle is 15 minutes in length and is referred to as an **EPOCH**.&#x20;

There are 35,040 EPOCH's in 1 year.



**EPOCH 1 - 11,520 :** 0.02400% every EPOCH **(First 4 Months)**

**EPOCH 11,520 - 23,040 :** 0.00240% every EPOCH **(Next 8 months)**

**EPOCH 23,040 - 35,040 :** 0.00024% every EPOCH **(Next 1 Years)**

**EPOCH 35,040 > :** 0.00002% every EPOCH **(In Perpetuity until max supply is reached)**
