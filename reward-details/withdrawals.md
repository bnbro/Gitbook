# üèß Withdrawals

In total there will be two balances you can withdraw your funds. Once you win the game and get rewarded with tokens you will be presented with multiple withdrawal options.

If you decide to withdraw your rewards the same day you received them, a fee of **70%** will be deducted. Every other day will cut the withdrawal fee by **10%** meaning that you will be able to withdraw your earnings **without any fee** in **7 days**.

{% hint style="info" %}
_**Please note that if you decide to withdraw your earnings 3 days after you received them, you will pay a fee of 30% but the next withdrawal will bring you back to the initial commission of 70%.**_
{% endhint %}

In case of an early withdrawal (if it happens earlier than 7 days since you received the winnings), the fee charged will be sent directly to the Treasury.
