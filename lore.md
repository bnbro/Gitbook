# ðŸ”® Lore

Our current weird and overly comfortable time has made humanity weak, helpless, and complacent. Olden Norse gods took notice of these more fragile times, brought everyone back to the 2000s using ancient technology, and drove everyone into a world filled with treacherous monsters buried deep in the blockchain.

Now players have to venture into the world of BNBRagnarok. A world that the old gods designed to challenge this weaker humankind, make them stronger, more vigilant, and even kinder towards others. These challenges do not come empty; Odin himself bestowed upon them for whosoever shall win, reaps the right to claim their rewards, in tokens of BNB, ZENY, and multitudes more!

You might be one of the chosen ones to defeat all the monsters plaguing the land. With that, you are allowed to multiply your ZENYâ€™s in a magic vault. Enforcing the strength of the BNBRagnarok kingdom will enrich your character beyond your wildest dreams. Over 300,000 magical charms infuse your ZENY with the power to grow over time.

While traveling the land and winning your ZENY from defeating monsters, you will be presented with opportunities to refine better and equip your characters to conquer even more gruesome creatures!

This is it; it is the time to rise! Gather your fellowship, grab your weapons, and travel all over Midgard and claim what was rightfully yours, true glory!
