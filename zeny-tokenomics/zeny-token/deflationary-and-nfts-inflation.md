# ðŸ”¥ Deflationary & NFT's Inflation

### **NFT Limited**

The quantity of Character is Limited. Players can buy only a maximum of 2 characters, if **** they want **** to buy more than 2 characters, players would need to increase their [Vip Level](../../bnbragnarok-guide/recruit-hero-nft/vip-system-upgrade.md#benefits-received-of-each-vip-level).

****

**NFT Max** : 50,000 NFT

#### Planned: Hero Refine and Equipment&#x20;

* **Applying the model of "upgrading rarity"**. Basically, **combining** copies of the same hero **or** equipment into one, helps in adjusting the NFT inflation in the game.

### REWARD POOL SUSTAINABILITY

Players are taxed 40% if they claim their $ZENY on the first day. The claimed tax is reduced by 2% every day, 0% tax is on the 20th day, this assures less fluctuation of $ZENY and a more sustainable system.

### IN-GAME TAXATION TOKENOMICS

**$ZENY** is also burned in the following ways:

* **30%** of the **ZENY** __ are consumed in the game will be permanently destroyed
* **5%** will be sent to Referral
* **65%** will be allocated to the Reward Pool
