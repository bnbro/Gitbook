# ðŸ›¡ Rug-Pull Prevention

Security is of the utmost importance for us! We hate seeing potential holders getting dumped, scammed, and being totally abandoned after the token goes live.

If you have a read of our Smart Contract, there is nothing about withdrawing from Reward Pool to any specific wallet, only to the Game SC.  So, the game continues to operate indefinitely as we continuously move funds from RP to Game SC so that users can keep earning as they play!

Another aspect for safety is token distribution, rules are made in code to prevent malicious maneuvres like dumping the tokens on our unsuspecting community.

### How?

* Token Vesting for Play to Earn will be distributed linearly for 24 months.
